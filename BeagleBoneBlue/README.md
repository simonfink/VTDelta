To optimize BeagleBone for education, BeagleBone Blue was created that integrates many components for robotics and machine control, including connectors for off-the-shelf robotic components. For education, this means you can quickly start talking about topics such as programming and control theory, without needing to spend so much time on electronics. The goal is to still be very hackable for learning electronics as well, including being fully open hardware.

BeagleBone Blue's legacy is primarily from contributions to BeagleBone Black robotics by [UCSD Flow Control and Coordinated Robotics Lab](http://robotics.ucsd.edu/), [Strawson Design](http://www.strawsondesign.com/), [Octavo Systems](http://octavosystems.com), [WowWee](http://www.wowwee.com/mip/), [National Instruments LabVIEW](http://www.ni.com/labview/) and of course the [BeagleBoard.org Foundation](https://beagleboard.org/about).

As a general rule, we don't encourage use of this or other off-the-shelf single board computers in commercial products without engaging with a manufacturer to create a supplier agreement and make sure that you can get material as your business demands. Further, we do update the design on occasions where we find it necessary and won't guarantee a supply of older revisions, though we do seek periodic manufacturing of all of our boards for a period of roughly 10 years and will make design changes to replace obsolete parts and that may impact your usage. If you do opt to use it in a product, you take full responsibility for that product.
